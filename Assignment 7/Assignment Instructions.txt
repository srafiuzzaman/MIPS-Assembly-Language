Implement MIPS assembly programs for each of the challenges listed below:

Create a single assembly program that starts by asking the user for 2 integer inputs and stores the values in appropriate registers (be sure to utilize meaningful input prompts to tell the user the input expectations). With those 2 values within the variables perform the following: 
Add the 2 integer inputs and print out the result to the console in the following format:
Least Value + Greatest Value = Result

Subtract the smaller value from the greatest value and print out the result to the console in the following format: Greatest Value - Least Value = Result

Subtract the smaller value from the greatest...then use a loop to add up every number from 1 to the subtracted result value. Meaning if the subtraction instruction produced a result of 4 then the loop would add together 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 to produce a result. Then output the final loop result to the console with meaningful text.
Each output should be on its own line (there are a couple of ways to force a line feed/return in MIPS...perhaps you could find some code examples through an Internet search). Be sure to utilize meaningful text to guide the end-users...remember that normal end-users will not be able to see your uncompiled code.

This assignment is asking you to draw on all the different MIPS knowledge, instructions, and techniques we have covered throughout the course.

Compile the program.

Run it and make sure it work.

Submit a screenshot of the result.
