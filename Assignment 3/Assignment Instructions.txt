For this assignment, please write the following MIPS programs:

1. stores the values 272 and 86 into variables...loads those 2 variables into registers...adds the values together...and finally prints the result to the console

2. stores the values 3844 and 791 into variables...loads those 2 variables into registers...subtracts the lower number from the greater...and finally prints the result to the console

3. stores the values 413 and 212 into variables...loads those 2 variables into registers...multiplies the values together with the mul instruction...and finally prints the result to the console

4. stores the literal values 5000 and 5 directly into registers...multiplies the values together with the mult instruction...and finally prints the result to the console

5. stores the literal values 716 and 19 directly into registers...divides 716 by 19...and finally prints the result AND the remainder to the console.
Compile all programs.

Run them and make sure they work.

Submit a screenshot of each result.

Submit all your asm files.
